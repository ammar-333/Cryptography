# Cryptography

Objective: Implement and analyze cryptographic algorithms using CrypTool.

Tasks:
1. Algorithm Selection:
o Choosed two cryptographic algorithms from the following categories:
▪ Symmetric Key Algorithms: DES
▪ Asymmetric Key Algorithms: RSA

2. Implementation:
o Implement the selected algorithms in CrypTool.
o Experiment with different key sizes, modes of operation (e.g., ECB, CBC for symmetric
encryption), and other parameters.
o Encrypt and decrypt sample data using these algorithms, documenting the process.

4. Analysis:
o Compare the performance and security features of the algorithms.
o Analyze the encryption speed, key management complexities, and any other relevant
metrics.
o Discuss the trade-offs between security and performance.
